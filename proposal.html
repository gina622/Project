    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      My website will be all about me; from my personal life to my career goals
      it will be a website that talks screams GINA ZHENG.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      The main objective of this website is for getting to know me better, to
      explore more of myself. Through this website, I want to self-reflect and
      just take a second to think more for my life. Recently, I've been too
      invested in my surroundings and circumstances that I haven't been able to
      have a lot of me time. I hope this website making will serve as that type
      of time for me.
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience would consist of those that want to get to know me
      better, making a portfolio of me. When talking about those who wants to
      know me better, I am also refering to myself. When making this semester
      project, I think I will be able to learn a lot about myself.
